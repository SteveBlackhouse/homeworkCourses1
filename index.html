        Easy Parking (February 2018 – now) - is designed to help drivers 
        quickly find a free space, improve parking space and ease traffic.
        Sensors embedded in the ground will determine whether parking 
        spaces are occupied or free. 
        Drivers will be able to get real-time parking information. 
        Drivers will be able to easily find a free space using a map when only 
        a few parking spaces are available.
